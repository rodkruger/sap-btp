# 🚀 SAP BTP Playground

**Welcome to my SAP BTP self-learning repository.** 

This is a collection of applications and code snippets designed to explore and test the capabilities of SAP BTP. The goal here is simple: learn by doing, even if that means things don’t always work on the first try.

## 🔍 What’s inside?

- **Learning Projects**: Focused on understanding the basics and advanced features of SAP BTP.
- **Experimental Apps**: Practical experiments to explore SAP BTP services and integration.
- **Demos**: Code examples showcasing different SAP BTP tools in action.

## 🤖 Why this repository?

Sometimes, documentation alone isn’t enough. This repository serves as a practical guide through trial and error (mostly error, but that’s where the learning happens). Use it to experiment and get hands-on with SAP BTP.

## 🛠️ How to use it?

1. **Clone, Test, Learn**: Try out the projects, adjust what you need, and see how they behave in real scenarios.
2. **Tweak and Adapt**: Feel free to improve the code or adapt it to your own use cases.
3. **Pull Requests Welcome**: Found a better way to do something? Submit a pull request. We appreciate improvements.

Keep in mind: if it works perfectly on the first try, well, you’re one of the lucky ones.
